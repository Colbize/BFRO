    <br>
    <b><br>
    The fee to attend:  $300 - $500 depending on the expedition. When you inquire about the expedition you are interested in, you will receive a reply with the fee amount for that specific trip.</b></font></h3>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><br>
  
  <br>If you plan to bring a group of people you will need to let us know the details -- the size of the group, and their ages, and their relationship to the primary attendee, and the number of vehicles involved. The fees will be negotiated based on that information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><br>
    The fee<em> </em>pays for the organizational efforts prior to the trip,  and any special-use permits, etc.  It takes a lot of time to do 
    this all properly. </b></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>The fee also helps  regulate the demand to attend, 
      while ensuring that only those people with 
      a serious interest in the subject will be the trip.<br>
      <br>
      The BFRO members you will spend a few days with are not guides but rather highly experienced amateur researchers who have volunteered to orient newcomers while exploring the area themselves.<br>
<br>
      Adult companions of an attendee may receive a fee discount, but the amount of the discount will depend on the particular expedition. You will be able to discuss the discount for your companion(s) when you speak with the BFRO administrator about your registration.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Prerequisites for participating:</u></b><u><br>
</u><br>
      1) Prior to the expedition you must be able to: </font></p>
  <blockquote><font color="#FFFFFF"> a) Send and receive email 
    when necessary,<br>
    <br>
    b) Periodically check a private message board on the Web, and <br>
<br>
    c) 
    Receive voicemail messages.<br>
  </font></blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> 2) You must have camping gear and clothing 
    for any weather conditions that may arise during the expedition.<br>
    <br>
    3) You must bring your own food, drinks, and water. <br>
<br>
    4) You must provide your own transportation.<br>
<br>
    5) For safety reasons you must be able to walk on two legs with no assistance 
    of any kind.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
    </font><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <br>
    <br>
    The fee does not pay for meals. You must bring your own food as if you are camping on your own. We tried catering once and it took way too much of our time and focus. It's much more efficient to let people decide what they want to eat, and when to eat. <br>
    <br>
    Most people bring a cooler from home and pick up additional groceries on the way to the base camp. The easiest way to handle meals is to have a cooler full of things to make sandwiches (or burritos) -- things you can wrap up and take with you in a day-pack, so you'll have food all day long. Eating small amounts throughout the day (rather than two large meals) will make it easier for you to continue moving late at night.</b><span class="arial"><b><br>
    <a name="exec"></a><br>
    <br>
    The Motel Option (for some expeditions)</b></span><b><br>
    <br>
    Over the years we have adapted <em>some</em> of the expeditions to make them easier for very busy people who do not have time to round up a bunch of camping gear beforehand. Other people who are flying in don't want to transport a bunch of camping equipment on a plane.    People in those situations can keep a room at a rural motel  <em>usually</em> within 20 miles or so from the base camp (some are futher), so they won't need any camping gear at all. They will only need warm clothes and a rental car. <br>
    <br>
    A decent size rental SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle) will give you four-wheel-drive mobility, and allow you to sleep in the back of the vehicle, if you choose. You would only need to buy a sleeping bag and a small air mattress at a Walmart on the way to camp from the airport. At the end of the expedition you can unload the sleeping bag and air mattress to someone on the trip and you'll still come out way ahead, compared to a motel. You just won't have the warm shower in the morning. On the plus side, that's the best way to get approached at night -- stay behind alone in your SUV after the group has returned to camp after stirring up some sasquatches. That will make a believer out of you  ... but be careful what you wish for ...<br>
    <br>
    For those expeditions with a motel option there is always at least one restaurant in the same area as the motel, so you won't need a cooler with sandwich fixins either. Also, BFRO people tend to be generous with their food at base camp ... especially when you're generous with your small bills.<br>
    <br>
    If you don't bring camping gear and you get a motel room instead, you would show up at base camp around noon. From there, small groups will form to drive out to selected areas. They'll explore those areas first by vehicle, to determine the best spots to return to at night. They will hike around a bit in those spots  during the day, and they'll follow creek beds to look for tracks (deer tracks as well as sasquatch tracks). They will also familiarize themselves with the trails among big trees or large obstructions that afford a good view of the road. They might set up trail cameras along those particular trails.<br>
    <br>
    They will return to base camp an hour or two before sundown, then eat and rest a bit, and then return to those chosen spots right after sundown. They'll stay out until midnight or so, changing locations as necessary. They will change locations until they get some responses to their mimicking sounds -- the various sounds that sasquatches respond to.  The process is repeated until some sasquatches are located, and hopefully lured to an encounter with the team. It's a process that works ... if you're in the right place at the right time of year.<br>
    <br>
    At some point after midnight the team will pull out and return to base camp. You can remain out there by yourself if you want, but newbies seldom volunteer for that duty ... You will most likely pull out with everyone else and return to base camp, then drive yourself 15-20 minutes back to your motel room to sleep. You can sleep in late the next morning and then return to camp around noon.  </b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>You can return to camp later in the day if you have a GPS, which would enable you to hook up with any of the teams that may have already headed out for the day. <br>
    <br>
    It's very flexible once you know where you are going. No one is given any orders or forced assignments. You decide where you want to go or who you want to follow. Everyone understands if you need to break off from the group to find a cell reception spot on a hill somewhere, but if you need to break off from the group then you need to let a few different people know, so we don't go into search-and-rescue mode unnecessarily. </b></font><br>

    You are not allowed to carry a gun in the field unless you head off completely on your own. Around other people you may carry a knife, a machette, a spear, pepper spray, etc. ... but not a gun. There is no need to carry a gun when you are with a group of people. <br>
    <br>
    There are no modern reports of sasquatches attacking humans. They will 
    sometimes approach and intimidate human intruders at night, but not attack 
    them. <br>
    <br>
    Guns in nervous hands put everyone else at risk. If you regularly travel with a gun in your car or camper, that is not a problem, but the gun should remain in your vehicle, unlesss you plan to head off by yourself for a long, long distance.<br>

    These expeditions do not get cancelled due to weather. We go to hot zones in 
    the winter, and cold zones in the summer, to minimize the interference 
    of weather.<br>
    <br>
    You should reserve a space on an expedition far in advance if you know 
    you want to go. These trips can fill up fast if. Some people wait til 
    the last minute to register but the trip is already full by then. It happens a lot, so sign up early if you're making plans to be there.

      <b>Q: If you are finding good evidence in one area, why go somewhere 
        else? Why not focus your attention and expeditions there?</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>A: </b>We do and we don't. The people who come on the expeditions 
      can focus on the target areas after the expedition if they choose. 
      Some do, and become part of a regional BFRO chapter. <br>
      <br>
      We don't focus <i>all</i> of our attention on one location. That 
      would be unwise. Among the most important things we are learning 
      from these expeditions is the range of their habitats, and the 
      commonalities of the evidence and behavior in these different 
      habitats. We are better, by a very wide margin, than any other group or 
      collective ever has been, at getting close to these animals, mainly 
      because we've explored so many different habitat areas across 
      the continent and compared notes. If we had not done that we would 
      know only a small fraction of what we know about this species.<br>
      <br>
      We have observed and experienced things that indicate patterns 
      of behavior, patterns that are consistent enough to anticipate in 
      other habitat areas. We think it is very important to see if those 
      same patterns exist  in other areas, and how they may vary.

    <b>Q: How many people are coming?</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>A:</b> 25 - 45 people will assemble at a base camp, then divide into smaller teams 
    which will include some experienced BFRO expeditioners. Some teams (usually the backpackers) choose to camp the entire time at 
    satellite camps in target areas. You will be able to decide what you want 
    to do. No one is forced to go anywhere, or stay 
    out all night. You decide who 
    you want to team up with, and how long you 
    want to stay out. We operate both during the day and at night, in shifts.

  <p> <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>A:</b> There are many goals on the expeditions. The 
    primary goal is to identify habitat areas.<br>
    <br>
    Other goals include, but are not limited to:<br>
    <br>
    - Observing (hearing) the behavior of sasquatches in different areas.<br>
    - Obtaining sound recordings, photos, video footage, and other evidence.<br>
    - Testing methods for attracting sasquatches toward a stimuli.<br>
    - Training people how to find sasquatches in their own areas.<br>
    - Meeting potential new members from various regions.<br>
    - Allowing potential new members to meet and execute missions together.<br>
